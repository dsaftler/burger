## burger

### Overview
This is a Node, Express, MySQL, ORM, Handebars project that emphasizes the MVC structure for separations of concerns, and presents a SPA (Single Page Application) 

All Console.log statements have been commented out except for connection & host confirmation.
---
### How it Works
- The application allows users to name a new style of Burger and Add It to the list of available burgers to be eaten.  The name can not be an empty string.
- A button beside each available burger allows the user to "Devour it"
- Devouring a burger moves it to the "Devoured" column, where no further functions are available.
- All burgers are maintained in the burger table in the burger_db database.

This version is completely functional, albeit limited in scope - for instance: 
- burgers can not be 'restored' to available
- burger names can't be changed once submitted
- burgers can't be deleted
